Now it's your turn to take an action, following these steps:

1. First, reason using ONLY ONE tag pair and express your reasoning in one concise, brief sentence:

<planning>
Plan or replan the entire task by breaking it down into high-level steps. Focus on outlining the full sequence required to complete the overall task, not just the immediate next action. 
Use this at the beginning of complex tasks or whenever the previous plan is incorrect or insufficient.
It is necessary to list all the points separately. eg, step 1: xxx, step 2: xxx, step 3: xxx, etc.
</planning>

<explore>
When results are unexpected or information is lacking, use current observations to think outside the box and list as many possible locations, items, or actions as possible.
Use this approach when facing obstacles that require creative and innovative thinking.
</explore>

<reflection>
Analyze the reasons for errors in task execution and correct them by exploring alternative approaches. 'No known action matches that input.' indicates the action is invalid.
This is typically used when several consecutive actions yield no substantial progress. 
</reflection>

<monitor>  
Continuously track the current progress and history of reasoning and execution throughout the task. Recall the current subgoal and consider the next concrete action, ensuring agent alignment with the overall plan.  
Typically used when task outcomes are as expected and no other mode of reasoning is required.
</monitor>

2. After your reasoning, you MUST select and present an appropriate action for the current step within <action> </action> tags.
