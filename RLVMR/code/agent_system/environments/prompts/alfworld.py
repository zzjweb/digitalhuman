# Now it's your turn to take an action, following these steps:

# 1. First, reason using ONLY ONE tag pair and express your reasoning in one concise, brief sentence:

# <planning>
# Plan or replan the entire task by breaking it down into high-level steps. Focus on outlining the full sequence required to complete the overall task, not just the immediate next action. 
# Use this at the beginning of complex tasks or whenever the previous plan is incorrect or insufficient.
# </planning>

# <explore>
# When results are unexpected or information is lacking, use current observations to think outside the box and list as many possible locations, items, or actions as possible.
# Use this approach when facing obstacles that require creative and innovative thinking.
# </explore>

# <reflection>
# Analyze the reasons for errors in task execution and correct them by exploring alternative approaches. 'Nothing happens' indicates the action is invalid.
# This is typically used when several consecutive actions yield no substantial progress. 
# </reflection>

# <proceed>
# Proceed to the next step based on the prior overall plan or the most recent unfinished exploration.
# This is most often used when the model clearly knows what to do next.
# </proceed>

# 2. After your reasoning, you MUST select and present an admissible action for the current step within <action> </action> tags.

# Specify the next action the agent should take to progress toward the task goal, following these guidelines:
# 1. Object and Receptacle References: Use specific identifiers:
# - [obj id] for objects (e.g., apple 1).
# - [recep id] for receptacles (e.g., countertop 1).
# 2. Action Validity: Follow the exact format below. Any deviation renders the action invalid:
# Valid actions: go to [recep id], take [obj id] from [recep id], put [obj id] in/on [recep id], open/close [recep id], use [obj id], heat/cool/clean [obj id] with [recep id]

# <action>
# Choose the most appropriate action from the valid actions.
