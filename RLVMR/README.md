# ***RLVMR***: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Meta-Reasoning Rewards for Robust Long-Horizon Agents


RLVMR provides agents with fine-grained meta-reasoning rewards, encouraging LLM agents to learn how to think rather than simply relying on straightforward outcome feedback.

![The RLVMR framework, comprising cold start and reinforcement learning phases, offers rule-verifiable feedback based on final outcomes and the comparative advantages of meta-reasoning behaviors.

# Environment Setup&#x20;



```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


We recommend maintaining a separate conda environment for each environment.

**ALFWorld**

```markdown 
conda create -n rlvmr-alfworld -y
conda activate rlvmr-alfworld
pip install gymnasium==0.29.1
pip install stable-baselines3==2.6.0
pip install alfworld
```


Download PDDL & Game files (by default saved in `~/.cache/alfworld/`):

```markdown 
alfworld-download -f
```


**ScienceWorld**

```bash 
conda create -n rlvmr-sciworld -y
conda activate rlvmr-sciworld
pip install scienceworld
```




Install verl and related dependencies.

```bash 
pip install -e .
```




# Start Training

1. **Prepare cold start data**

Prepare a small-batch cold-start set of expert demonstration trajectories. Here, you need to replace YOUR\_API\_KEY with your own API key.

Prepare for ALFWorld:

```python 
python scripts/alfworld_prepare.py
```


Prepare for ScienceWorld:

```bash 
python scripts/sciworld_prepare.py
```


2. **Cold Start**

You can refer to the following startup script to switch to different models or modify configuration parameters.

```bash 
bash examples/sft/cold_start/run_alfworld_qwen2.5-7b.sh

```


```bash 
bash examples/sft/cold_start/run_sciworld_qwen2.5-7b.sh
```


3. **RL Training:**

Before starting the training script, you need to set `actor_rollout_ref.model.path` to the cold start model path.

```bash 
bash examples/rlvmr_trainer/run_alfworld.sh
```


```bash 
bash examples/rlvmr_trainer/run_sciworld.sh
```


# Customize

- **Meta-reasoning reward rules**

You can modify or add your custom meta-reasoning reward rules in the `process_trajectory_rlvmr_rewards` function located in `rlvmr/core_rlvmr.py`.

- **New Enviroments**

To add a new environment:

1. Create your environment package in `agent_system/environments/env_package/`, ensuring it follows the gym interface and supports multi-threading.
2. Write the corresponding prompt files in the `agent_system/environments/prompts/` directory.
3. Add an environment manager in `agent_system/environments/env_manager.py` to provide multi-threading support.
